* The Situation

We were hired as apprentice developers to work on a highly-interactive LiveView app.

It needed to work "like an App"

A mobile website was not going to cut it.

* Scalable Fault-Tolerant Concurrent Soft-Real-Time Demo App

* What's a PWA?
** A set of tools to:

- Enable your website to behave like an app
- Telegraph to the client that it can treat your website like an app

** Anatomy of a PWA

- Service Worker
- Hi-res icon
- App Manifest

* Outgrowing your PWA

- No background media playback
- Limited local storage
- No notifications (this may change in iOS 16)
- *Not distributed in App Stores*

* Capacitor?
** NO

* WebView wrapper

PWA Builder

* LiveState

⚠️️ New! Experimental! ⚠️️

Make /anything/ work like LiveView


* How LiveView works
- Initialize stateful server-side process
- Establish socket connection
- Render HTML
- Listen for events
- Push DOM patch on state change

* How LiveState works
- Initialize stateful server-side process
- Establish socket connection
- Render +HTML+ *JSON*
- Listen for events
- Push +DOM+ *JSON* patch on state change

* JSONPatch
